                The term "socialism" has become a term used as a scare tactic
                and often has no relevance to what it is being projected at.
                Demanding that workers are fairly compensated for the profits
                they generate for their employer is not socialism. What is
                socialism is public education, public roadways, police and fire
                departments, public sewer and water systems, medicare, social
                security, etc. The purveyors of such language are banking on the
                general public not educating themselves on true definitions and
                believing falsehoods specifically designed to keep us poor and
                divided.

                The majority of media we consume is owned by billionaires who
                profit off keeping workers' wages and rights suppressed. While
                most of the population are amiable and kind, the media displays
                extremes to make "the other side" appear to be terrible people.
                Additionally, any minor difference in opinion is manufactured
                into a major crisis to keep the public at each others' throats.
                It is highly likely that organizers of extremist groups are
                funded to keep tension high. Fear is a powerful tactic to gain
